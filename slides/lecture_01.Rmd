### Conclusions

What did the researchers conclude about their research question?
]

* An increase of 1,000 home fans is associated with an increase of 1.4 points in the home team's margin of victory, after controlling for other factors
* So, home teams tend to perform better when they have more fans
* Is there anything you would do differently?
